Guardianes Inform√°ticos - Technical Exam

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration
  You must edit you config/credentials.yml by running the following command:
  ```console
    EDITOR="YOUR_FAVORITE_EDITOR" rails credentials:edit 
  ```

  If you are using an editor like Visual Studio Code, or Sublime, you probably will need to add an extra command:
  ```console
    EDITOR="YOUR_FAVORITE_EDITOR" --wait rails credentials:edit
  ```

  Please make sure that the credentials are configured as shown in this example for the 
  application to work property:

  ```yml
  # You can set only the environtment you are using
  db:
    development:
      endpoint: YOUR_DEV_ENDPOINT
      database: YOUR_DB_NAME
      username: YOUR_DB_USER_NAME
      password: YOUR_DB_USER_PASSWORD
    test:
      endpoint: YOUR_TEST_ENDPOINT
      database: YOUR_DB_NAME
      username: YOUR_DB_USER_NAME
      password: YOUR_DB_USER_PASSWORD
    production:
      endpoint: YOUR_PRODUCTION_ENDPOINT
      database: YOUR_DB_NAME
      username: YOUR_DB_USER_NAME
      password: YOUR_DB_USER_PASSWORD
  smtp:
    # You can use letter_opener or a similar gem for development
    # and another service like SES for production
    delivery_method: YOUR_DELIVERY_METHOD
  # Use this only if you are using SES as SMTP delivery method 
  # and/or S3 as storage service.
  # You can read how to configure S3 here
  # https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html
  aws:
    s3: 
      access_key_id: YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      secret_access_key: YOUR_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      region: YOUR_S3_REGION
      bucket: YOUR_S3_BUCKET
    ses:
      access_key_id: YOUR_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      secret_access_key: YOUR_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

  secret_key_base: A_VERY_LONG_STRING_USED_AS_BASE_FOR_MESSAGEVERIFIERS_IN_RAILS
  ```

* Database creation

  Once your credentials are set, you can set up your database using
  ```console
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    rails db:seeds
  ```

  If you don't specify the environment, rails will default to **development**. However, 
  you can change this behavior like this
  ```console
    rails db:create RAILS_ENV=test
  ```

  In the repository, only one user is created: **chermosilla** with
  password **recorrido123**. You can add more users editing the *db/seeds/ENVIRONMENT.rb"
  file


* Database initialization

  Alternatively, you can condense the whole setup of the database running
  ```console
    rails db:setup
  ```

* How to run the test suite

  

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
